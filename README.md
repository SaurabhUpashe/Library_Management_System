## 📖 Project Description

This project aims to digitalize library operations like book inventory management, borrow/return workflows, and user authentication. The system consists of multiple roles:

- **User**: View available books; request to borrow and return them.

The system uses **JSP with EL**, **Servlets for business logic**, and **JDBC** to connect to a **MySQL database**. The interface is built with embedded **HTML/CSS/JS**, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience.
